# ch32v003_fun I2C Library

This is a simplified library for I2C, used with [ch32v003_fun](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun)  
It supports ONLY 8-Bit Addresses and 8-Bit Registers.

Based on an [example library](https://github.com/hexeguitar/ch32v003fun_libs/blob/main/ch32v003_i2c.h),
but with better comments, more easily used error codes - The ability to use alternative pins has
been removed for the sake of simplicity and ease of understanding.  
If you want to use ANY pins for I2C, see [lib_software_i2c]
